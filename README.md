# About this repo
Hello! Welcome to our GitHub repository!

This project is the result of our team's hard work and dedication as part of a school assignment aimed at learning and skill development. We want to make it clear that this is not a commercial project. It is a school project designed to enhance our technical skills, knowledge, and understanding in areas like programming, web development, and other related technologies.

For this project, we have chosen to use Adidas products as a case study and for simulation purposes. However, we are fully aware that Adidas is a brand protected by copyright and intellectual property laws. Therefore, we would like to emphasize that none of the content in this project is intended for commercial purposes, and we do not use Adidas products for any business-related goals. Any use of the Adidas name, logo, or other brand elements is purely for educational and simulation purposes as part of our academic work.

We highly respect the importance of copyright and intellectual property rights, and we have taken steps to ensure that we are operating in compliance with all applicable laws. This project focuses solely on improving our technical skills, including coding, design, and problem-solving, without any intention to infringe on the intellectual property of others.

Moreover, all content we have created for this project is original, produced by our team, with the exception of references to certain brands or products that are used strictly for illustrative and educational purposes. We always strive to show the utmost respect for third-party intellectual property rights.

We hope that this project will not only help us grow as students but also provide useful insights for others interested in web development, design, or technology. If you are interested in learning more about the project or have any suggestions, feel free to reach out to us. We are always open to constructive feedback!

Thank you for visiting, and we hope you enjoy exploring this project as much as we enjoyed creating it.
